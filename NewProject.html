<h1>Create the Project</h1>
<p> In IntelliJ from welcome screen or under FILE select "new Project".
    Choose "Maven", then, "from archetype" and "Maven webapp".</p><br/>

<p> Give your project a descriptive name that tells you what it is and choose Next a couple
of times.</p><br/>

<h1>Copy in dependencies from another POM</h1><br/>

<h1>Add needed directories for java, resources, and test</h1>
<p>Select the main directory in the project view</p><br/>

<p>Right click and choose "New" and then Directory. Name the directory "java" all lowercase!
Otherwise, Maven won't know what to do with it.
    You can choose refactor and rename to fix this if you get it wrong.</p>
<p>Right click on the new java directory and choose "mark Directory" and then "sources Root".
    This tells Maven to look here for things to compile.</p>
<p>Right click on the java directory again and choose "New" and then package.
Give it a name like "entity" or "persistence".
    Repeat as needed to build out your package structure.</p>
<p>Right click on the src directory and follow the same steps to create a
    new directory called "test". Under it create a directory called "java".
    Follow the same instructions to mark it, but mark it as "test
Sources Root" instead of just "sources Root". This will tell Maven where to find the unit tests.</p>
<p>Finally, you can create a resources directory under test and mark it as test resources.</p>
